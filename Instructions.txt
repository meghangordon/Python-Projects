DATABASE SUBMISSION ASSIGNMENT

For this assignment, you will need to write a script that creates a database and adds new data into that database.


REQUIREMENTS:


Your script will need to use Python 3 and the sqlite3 module.

Your database will require 2 fields: an auto-increment primary integer field and a field with the data type “string.”

Your script will need to read from the supplied list of file names at the bottom of this page and determine only the files from the list which end with a .”txt” file extension. To clarify, the Python code shown in the SETUP INSTRUCTIONS should be inserted exactly as shown into your script as a python list. You do not need to create a folder on your computer that contains these files.

Next, your script should add those file names from the list ending with “.txt” file extension within your database.

Finally, your script should legibly print the qualifying text files to the console.

Add comments throughout your Python explaining your code. Adding comments to your code is a good practice, and is expected in the industry. It will help you understand what your code is doing and will also make it easier when you need reference back to previous projects.

SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:


The following is the list of file names to use for this assignment:



As a reminder, this list only needs to be typed into the program -- you do not need to actually have these files on your computer.
